Weather Data Downloader
=======================

Functions to download data from Numerical Weather Prediction Models
from NOAA and ECMWF.  There's a script to make this simpler for North
America (defined basically as the north-west semi-hemisphere).

It is simplest to extend this package to data using a Thredds server
with netCDF subset service.  Examples are given for the GFS, NAM, and
RAP models run by NOAA's National Centers for Environmental Prediction
(NCEP).
